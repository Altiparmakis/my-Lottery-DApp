# lottery-ballot DApp

## Overview

The `lottery-ballot` DApp is a decentralized lottery system built using React and Web3 to interact with a Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. 
Users can participate in a lottery draw by placing bids for items. After the draw, winners are declared, and users can check if they have won any items.

## Features

- Place bids for items in the lottery draw.
- Two managers have control over the contract (e.g., destroying the contract, setting a new manager, declaring winners).
- Users can only check if they've won after the draw.
